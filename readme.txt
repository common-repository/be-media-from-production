For developers - Uses local media when available, and uses the production server for the rest.

== Description ==

When spinning up a staging or local development environment, you might not need the full uploads directory, but you also donâ€™t want to see broken images throughout the site.

This plugin lets you use the production server for missing media. Define the production URL using a wp-config.php constant BE_MEDIA_FROM_PRODUCTION_URL or filter be_media_from_production_url.

In all cases, if a local file exists, it will be used in preference to the remote file.

== Installation ==

Once the plugin is installed, add the following constant to wp-config.php with your production URL.

`
define( 'BE_MEDIA_FROM_PRODUCTION_URL', 'https://www.billerickson.net' );
`

Alternatively, you can use the filter in a Code Snippets plugin or a mu-plugin:

`
add_filter( 'be_media_from_production_url', function() {
	return 'https://www.billerickson.net';
});
`

**Installation via WP-CLI and constants**

`
wp plugin install --activate be-media-from-production
wp config set BE_MEDIA_FROM_PRODUCTION_URL https://www.billerickson.net --type=constant
`

**Using with WP Migrate**

[WP Migrate](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro/) is my preferred tool for pushing/pulling databases between environments. The media files functionality allows you to transfer media between environments along with the database.

When redesigning a website, I keep all the media on my development server and push up new media uploads along with the database.

Set up a "push" profile to push your local database to the development server. Make sure "Media Files" is checked and select "Compare, then upload".

Set up a "pull" profile to pull the development database locally. Do not include media in your pull. Any missing media will be handled by BE Media from Production.
